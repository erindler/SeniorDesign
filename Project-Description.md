## Project Topic Area

Our project focuses on **image and video processing AI** to optimize pesticide application in farming.  
A camera mounted on existing farm equipment collects visual data, which is transmitted to the cloud.  
An AI model analyzes the data to determine when and which crops require spraying, and the results are displayed in a user-friendly application.  
This solution aims to reduce chemical waste, lower costs, and improve crop health through precision agriculture.
