As for farmer, I want to check the health of my crops using the drone's defect detection functionality

As a fertilizer application engineer, I would like to locate the sections of the field that need fertilizer in order to fertlize my field appropriately.

As a farmer, I would like see the footage of crops and manually spray the pesticides out of schedule when needed too. I would like to also have info on other factors such as temperature, humidity, etc.
